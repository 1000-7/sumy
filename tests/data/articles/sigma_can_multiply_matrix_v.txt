service provider" recited in claim 4, claim 14 recites an "Internet service provider."

As  noted  in  Section  IV(B)(4),  Chelliah  teaches  the  limitations  of  claim  4.  To  the

extent  that  an  "Internet  service  provider"  differs  from  a  "value-added  network

service provider," Petitioner notes  that  the  store  relied upon  in Section  IV(B)(4)  to

disclose "value-added network service provider" also discloses an "Internet service

provider"  because  the  stores  are  accessible  over  the  Internet.  (See  Section

IV(B)(1)(c).) Thus, Chelliah discloses the limitations of claim 14.

9.  Gifford anticipates claim 17.
Claim 17 depends from claim 10 and further recites "wherein said value-

added network service providers cooperate to provide said plurality of

transactional services to said user." Gifford teaches that at least two different

entities cooperate to provide transactional services to the user. The first is the

content provider that controls the merchant (e.g., in the example of FIG. 2, the

content provider is the New York Times). (Sirbu Decl., ¶ 83.) The second is the

entity that facilitates payment via the payment computer (e.g., Mastercard, Visa,

American Express, or Discover in the embodiment of FIG. 5). (Sirbu Decl., ¶ 83.)

The merchant computer 63, 64 and the payment computer 68 (and their associated

entities) "cooperate" to perform the purchase. (Sirbu Decl., ¶ 83; see also Gifford,

3:15-25.)

10.  Gifford anticipates independent claim 35.
Independent claim 35 recites similar features as claim 1. Thus, Petitioner has

provided  the  following  claim  chart  indicating  the  correspondence  between

limitations of claim 35 and claim 1.

Limitation

A configurable value-added network
system for enabling real-time
transactions on a network, said
configurable value-added network
system comprising:

means for switching to a transactional
application in response to a user
specification from a network
application,

said transactional application providing
a user with a plurality of transactional
services managed by at least one value-
added network service provider,

said value-added network service
provider keeping a transaction flow
captive,

said plurality of transactional services
being performed interactively and in
real time;

means for activating an agent to create a
transaction link between said user
application and said transactional
application

Corresponding
limitation in Claim 1
A configurable value-
added network switch
for enabling real-time
transactions on a
network, said
configurable value-
added network switch,
comprising:
means for switching to a
transactional application
in response to a user
specification from a
network application,
said transactional
application providing a
user with a plurality of
transactional services
managed by at least one
value-added network
service provider,
said value-added
network service provider
keeping a transaction
flow captive,
said plurality of
transactional services
being performed
interactively and in real
time,

means for transmitting a transaction

IV(B)(1)(f)

means for transmitting a
transaction request from
said transactional
application;
See section (b) below.

a host means for processing said
transaction request and retrieving data
corresponding to said transaction
request.
(a)  Gifford  teaches  "means  for  activating  an  agent  to  create  a
transaction
link  between  said  user  application  and  said
transactional application."

See
subsection
(b) below

The  structure  in  the  ‘500  Patent  corresponding  to  "means  for  activating  an

agent  to  create  a  transaction  link  between  said  user  application  and  said

transactional  application"  is  a  graphical  user  interface.    Gifford  discloses  this

limitation.

FIG. 3 of Gifford  shows a purchase  screen  that  includes  links 5, 6, 7, and 8,

which  activate  the  agent.  (Sirbu  Decl.,  ¶  84;  see  also  Gifford,  5:19-29.)

Specifically, when  the  user  selects  link  5,  by,  for  example,  clicking with  a mouse,

an  HTTP  request  is  generated  by  the  buyer  computer  and  transmitted  to  the

merchant  computer.  (Sirbu Decl.,  ¶ 84) A person of ordinary  skill  in  the  art would

appreciate  that  this HTTP  request  causes  the web  server  to  activate  an  application

on  the  merchant  computer  that  keeps  the  response  to  the  HTTP  request  pending

while  the  merchant  computer  is  waiting  for  a  communications  from  the  payment

computer  indicating  the purchase has been approved. (Sirbu Decl., ¶ 84) Thus,  this

application  functions  as  an  agent  to  create  (and  maintain)  a  transaction  link
